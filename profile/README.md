## What is EditPad Lite?

**EditPad Lite** is a fast, lightweight, and highly efficient text editor designed for programmers, writers, and everyday users who need a reliable tool for editing code and text files. Unlike bulky IDEs, EditPad Lite focuses on speed, simplicity, and essential features like **syntax highlighting**, which colorizes code to improve readability and reduce errors.

With EditPad Lite, users can enjoy a clean, distraction-free writing environment that supports multiple programming languages, markup formats, and custom file types. Whether you're coding in Python, writing HTML, or taking quick notes, EditPad Lite ensures a smooth and responsive experience without unnecessary complexity.

Its minimalist design doesn’t sacrifice functionality—powerful features like regex search, auto-indentation, and encoding detection are all included. Best of all, EditPad Lite is completely **free and open-source**, making it accessible to everyone from students to professional developers.
